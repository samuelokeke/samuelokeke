# Welcome to my Github Profile!

Hi there, I am glad you made it here, what are you looking for? Projects i have worked on, i suppose. Take your time and go through my codebase if you like. I am 
always open to showing off what i can do. However, if you see anything you like, feel free to reach out for a collaboration.

## About Me 👋 

I’m Samuel Okeke, a seasoned, experienced, passionate and enthusiastic software development, with an excellent track record. I am confident about my skills, and i enjoy talking about them. My goal is always to keep the project on the roll until fruition. I like to practice a lot to keep myself up to date with current technologies and versions.

## Interest 👀 

I’m interested in working as a frontend developer or backend developer, however frontend is my strongest suit. Its okay to be in doubt but i am quick to delivery, spontaneous with implementation, and thorough with my tickets.

## Current Goal 🌱 

I’m currently learning mobile development with React native and Flutter, and i can't wait to show off my skills in mobile app development just as i have demonstrated in
web development.

**Fun fact:**

> I have a knack for following conventions, doesn't matter if it works regardless.
